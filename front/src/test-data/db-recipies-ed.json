Place in oven-safe dish and allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the rest of the ingredients and some salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nSpread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.\r\n\r\nNote: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. ",

Stirring constantly and scraping back any foam that clings to the side of the pan, let this mixture boil for about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool while, in a separate bowl, you beat the eggs until creamy. \r\n\r\nWhen the boiled syrup has cooled, beat in the eggs, salt and pecans. Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* A little cream (about 1\/4 to 1\/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. \r\n\r\n* For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. \r\n\r\n* The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

Spoon meringue into pan lightly, building up the edges to come at least 1\/2 inch above the side of the pan. Bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until light brown. Cool completely before adding filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Melt chocolate and water in a pan over hot, but not boiling, water, stirring occasionally, to blend. Add vanilla and chocolate mixture (cooled) to whipped cream and pile into meringue shell, swirling top with spatula. Be sure to cool the chocolate mixture before adding to the whipped cream. If it is too warm, the mixture will thin out. If this happens, chill until it is thick enough to put in shell.",

Pour batter into a 10\" x 10\" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.\r\n\r\nOnce the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",
